                                    assign a rate of the party pass and shall also provide information such as the event
                                    description, check-in date, check-out date, check-in time, check-out time,

                        <li>Once the party organizer confirms the reservation of a party attendant, the organizer is
                            responsible for fulfilling the reservation with the exact specifications that the organizer
                            listed.

                                <li>To make a reservation, a party attendant must first browse the listings on
                                    housepartybyunited.com for the upcoming house parties that match what the party
                                    attendant is seeking. When the party attendant finds a desirable event, the
                                    attendant
                                    places a “booking request” to reserve the place in the said house party. All booking
                                    requests are final and, once placed, cannot be canceled or retracted. Placing a
                                    booking request does not complete the reservation. Party Organizers have 72 hours
                                    to receive notification of a reservation and confirm the booking. The reservation is
                                    complete and takes effect only after the party organizer has confirmed the
                                    reservation and the attendant’s credit or debit card has been charged.House-Party

                                <li>To make a reservation, a party attendant must first browse the listings on
                                    housepartybyunited.com. for the upcoming house parties that match what the party
                                    attendant is seeking. When the party attendant finds a desirable event, the
                                    attendant
                                    places a “booking request” to reserve the place in the said house party. All booking
                                    requests are final and, once placed, cannot be canceled or retracted. Placing a
                                    booking request does not complete the reservation. Party Organizers have 72 hours
                                    to receive notification of a reservation and confirm the booking. The reservation is
                                    complete and takes effect only after the party organizer has confirmed the
                                    reservation and the attendant’s credit or debit card has been charged.House-Party
